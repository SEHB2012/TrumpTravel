# Can a few words from a U.S. president really change cross-border travel patterns?
 Investigating the Impact of Political Rhetoric on U.S.-Canada Trip Travel volume 

 ## Abstract
 This project aims to investigate the impact of political rhetoric on the U.S.-Canada trip travel patterns and volume. With the recent statements made by President Donald Trump about Canada and the Canadian government, the report will examine travel patterns between the two countries to determine if they are affected by political statements through analysis of travel data and trends across citizens of both countries between the period of January 2000 to January 2025. By understanding current trends and developing an interrupted time-series model for analysis, the report can identify changes in travel counts between Canada and the United States. Broadly, the report asks: “Can a few words from a U.S. president really change cross-border travel patterns?” However, the report specifically aims to answer, “Does hostile international policy have an effect on the travel plans of countries being targeted?”
